## Description

The Gemini Clone project is built using React, aiming to offer a seamless experience by emulating the Gemini application. For my educational purposes, this clone serves as a solid foundation has helped me to manage an AI api, in a simple environment by sending questions and receiving dynamic answers, to display them in the interface. Also, with the use of Css, I have designed a simple and user friendly view of the answers that the AI API sends us.
